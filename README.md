# TCCC 2019 - Where's my Stuff? Exploring Modern Compute and Storage Patterns

Data is the currency of tomorrow, and with the explosion of IoT, edge devices, cloud computing and cheap storage it's never been more important to define and build around a solid data architecture. The tools of yesterday brought us to where we are, but the relational engine is not your only choice. In this session we look at storage options, including Relational, NoSQL and Document databases including SQL Azure, MySQL, Cosmos DB and Azure Storage, and show pros and cons of each. We walk thru converting a real application from using SQL Server to using storage options in the cloud, including SQL Database, table storage and Cosmos DB. We see how to leverage storage patterns to make the most out of our investment in the cloud.
